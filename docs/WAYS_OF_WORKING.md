# Ways of Working

## Cadence
- Daily standup (10 minutes)
- 2x weekly engineering sync
- Weekly demo + retrospective

## Collaboration
- Async-first: documented decisions; summary in main channel
- Use issues for work items; PRs for changes; ADRs for key decisions
- Small, frequent merges to trunk

## Quality
- Pre-commit hooks enabled
- CI runs sanity checks on PRs
- Definition of Done in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Communication
- Main channel for announcements
- Per-pod channels for execution
- Escalations follow `RUNBOOKS/ONCALL.md`
